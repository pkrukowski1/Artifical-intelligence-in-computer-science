# Artificial intelligence in information systems
In the summer semester 2021/2022 I attended the course "Artificial intelligence in information systems" at the AGH University of Science and Technology, at the end of which I made a project together with my team. The aim of the project was to implement the fuzzy logic of a grass sprinkler in Arduino. To do that we have used website wokwi.com, where we can find free online Arduino simulator.

If you want to use these files, just download it as .zip and read it on Wokwi. Then start the simulation.
